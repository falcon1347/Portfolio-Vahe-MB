# Portfolio-Vahe-MB


Welcome to my portfolio repository.

I am a Computer Engineering student at the Universitat Oberta de Catalunya (UOC) with a professional background in CNC machining and industrial manufacturing. This repository will progressively collect exercises, assignments and personal projects related to:

- Programming and software development  
- Computer Engineering subjects (data structures, distributed systems, etc.)  
- Projects connected to CNC systems, machining and industrial automation  

The aim of this portfolio is to have a central place where I can organise, document and share the code and technical work I develop during my studies and in my free time.

## Repository contents

Over time, this repository will be organised into several folders, for example:

- `university/` – Academic projects, assignments and practice exercises from my Computer Engineering degree at UOC.  
- `personal/` – Personal experiments, small applications and prototypes.  
- `cnc_and_automation/` – Projects and examples that connect programming with CNC machines, machining processes and automation in industrial environments.

At the moment, the repository may be mostly empty or in its early stages, but it will grow as I advance in my degree and professional development.

## Technologies and areas of interest

Some of the technologies and topics that are likely to appear in this portfolio include:

- Programming languages: **Python**, **Java**, and others used in my degree  
- Concepts from **distributed systems** and **networked applications**  
- Scripting and tools to support **CNC workflows**, **machining** and **industrial automation**  
- General software engineering practices: version control, testing, documentation, etc.

## About me

I have several years of experience working with CNC machines and machining processes, and I am currently studying Computer Engineering to deepen my knowledge in software development and modern computing systems.

My goal is to combine my practical experience in manufacturing with my technical training in software, in order to work on projects that link the digital and industrial worlds.
